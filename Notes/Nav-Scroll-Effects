|| Goal
Highlight nav bar element if section is visible (dominant) on screen
Only one nav element highlighted at a time
Do this using .css() jQuery to add an 'active' class to add/remove an 'active' class as needed

|| Likely side effects
If smooth scrolling nav in use, this function will add/remove 'active' classes as sections pass by
This is acceptable.

|| Potential solution 
- If element is at top of screen or above, add '.active'
- If element bottom bounds passes beyond top of screen, remove '.active'
# This should avoid multiple nav elements being '.active' at once

- NOTE must retain .active class until next nav element becomes .active
- So could build in an offset equal to the .section bottom margin (currently 8em)
# Solution breaks if margin changes
- Instead do not trigger removal of .active class until the addition of the
next .active class is triggered

|| Pseudo

on Scroll
  func NavHighlight()
    if $.section is within bounds and does not contain .active css
      Find matching nav element
      Highlight
